# CaseStudy

My recipe project, titled "Dollar Store Spoon University", is a website where users can find quick, easy, and economical meals. As users progress in their cooking journey, they can upload their own recipes and share their cooking expertise with other users. 

### User Stories
-Users should be able to register their email and password to make an account. 
-Users should be able to find recipes.
-Users should be able to create their own recipes.
-Users should be able to update and delete their recipes. 


### Tools and Technologies Used
I used Spring MVC, TomCat 9.0 server, and My SQL Workbench. I connected my backend on Eclipse through JPA so it could communicate with MySQL Workbench. Dollar Store Spoon University is a Web Application that has full CRUD functionality. 


### Technical Challenges
One hurdle I had to overcome was my Server and Database. I believe I may have installed it incorrectly and because of that it caused me many difficulties with my project. I'm fairly new to building Dynamic Web Applications and Spring MVC was a toally new technology to me. It was a bit of a learning curve and I had to spend quite some time outside of class figuring out how to use it properly. 

I also had a bit of trouble with session management and retreiving user input from the forms. This was a simple fix, but it took me a long time to figure out what exactly the issue was. I eventually was able to fetch user input and insert it into the database without any issue.
